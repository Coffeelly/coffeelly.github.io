The Cyclistic case study analyzed bike-share data to differentiate usage between annual members and casual riders. Data was cleaned and transformed, revealing that members used bikes primarily on weekdays for short commutes within the city, while casual riders preferred weekends for longer recreational rides in parks and lakes. Visualizations highlighted these patterns. Recommendations focused on targeted marketing, specialized memberships, and seasonal discounts to increase annual memberships.
