## Projects
### Job-CV Matching System with Vector Search
[Github](https://github.com/bwbayu/JobFitte)

This project is an AI-powered job matching web application aimed at helping job seekers, especially in the IT industry, find suitable job opportunities based on their skills. The system leverages vector search technology to match resumes with job descriptions effectively.

### Clothing Multi-Label Classification
[Github](https://github.com/Khaairi/Clothing_Multilabel_Classification)

This project presents the implementation of a multi-label classification model designed to classify clothing attributes. The project was developed as part of the Hology Data Mining 2024 Preliminary Competition, organized by Universitas Brawijaya. It focuses on categorizing images of T-shirts and hoodies from various online stores in Indonesia based on their type (e.g., T-shirt or hoodie) and color (e.g., black, blue, white, etc.).

### Cyclist Data Analysis
[Github](https://github.com/Coffeelly/Cyclist-Data-Analysis)

In this project, I analyzed Cyclistic bike-share data using Python and Pandas to compare usage patterns between annual members and casual riders. I cleaned and processed a year's worth of ride data, revealing that members predominantly use bikes for weekday commutes, while casual riders prefer weekend recreational trips. Based on these insights, I developed data-driven recommendations for targeted marketing and membership strategies, demonstrating my ability to extract actionable insights from large datasets.
